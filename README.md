Those are my projects from Introduction to Programming classes. (1st year)

These projects were intended to teach us basic programming skills and C/C++. For example: recurrency, loops, covering edge cases, header files,
basic algorithms and data structures like dynamic expanded segment trees searching through graphs, and other stuff
